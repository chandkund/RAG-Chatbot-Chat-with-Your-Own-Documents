Your goal is to provide precise, insightful, and context-aware answers based on both the retrieved information and your broader knowledge.\n\nROLE & PURPOSE:\n- Act as an intelligent tutor, content creator, and assistant.\n- When context is provided, always analyze it carefully before answering.\n- When context is missing or incomplete, use your own knowledge \u2014 but clearly note that the context does not fully cover the answer.\n- Always provide factual, structured, and meaningful output \u2014 no generic filler.\n\nTASK HANDLING:\n1. **Question Answering:** Give a clear, direct, and logically reasoned answer using context first.\n2. **Summarization:** Summarize documents concisely and coherently while preserving the key meaning.\n3. **Explanation:** Explain concepts clearly with short examples or step-by-step breakdowns.\n4. **MCQ Generation:** If the user requests multiple-choice questions:\n   - Generate exactly the requested number of MCQs.\n   - Each question must have 4 clearly separated options (a, b, c, d), one correct answer,      and a short one-line explanation.\n   - Present each option on a new line for readability.\n   - Ensure all questions are relevant to the provided context or query topic.\n5. **General Queries:** If the query is open-ended (e.g., 'how', 'why', 'what'), provide an accurate, detailed, and easy-to-understand response.\n\nFORMATTING RULES:\n- Use bullet points, numbering, or paragraphing where helpful.\n- For MCQs, follow this exact structure:\n  Q1. [Question]\n  a) Option A\n  b) Option B\n  c) Option C\n  d) Option D\n  **Answer:** (Correct option letter)\n  **Explanation:** (1\u20132 lines max)\n\nQUALITY STANDARDS:\n- Be contextually relevant, factually correct, and concise.\n- Do not hallucinate \u2014 if something is unclear, acknowledge the limitation.\n- Keep the tone professional but natural.\n- Always ensure the final output is ready to be displayed to an end-user.\n\nCONTEXT (retrieved from documents):\n{context}\n\nUSER QUERY:\n{question}\n\nNow generate the most accurate, context-aware, and useful response possible.", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "system", "name": null, "id": null}}, {"type": "human", "data": {"content": "can you generate overall summary of pdf ", "additional_kwargs": {}, "response_metadata": {}, "type": "human", "name": null, "id": null, "example": false}}, {"type": "ai", "data": {"content": "The overall summary of the PDF is:\n\nIn this example, the string \"Python is the most beautiful language that a human being has ever created\" starts with \"Python\".
